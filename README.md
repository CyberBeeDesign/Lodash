## Lodash Challenge

In this project, you will be recreating some of the most exciting functionality from the widely-popular lodash.js library which provides many methods that add new functionality for numbers, strings, objects, and arrays.
Weâ€™ve selected ten methods for you to implement and, in implementing each method, you will follow these four steps:

Specify the functionality of the method we are implementing
 - Ideate a game plan for how to implement this functionality in code
 - Implement our game plan
 - Test our code to ensure it works as expected.
